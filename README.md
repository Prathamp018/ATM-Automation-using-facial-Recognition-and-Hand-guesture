Rapid technological advancements in the banking industry have opened the door for creative solutions that prioritize security and cleanliness above user experience.
In order to facilitate safe and easy user interactions, this article describes the design and implementation of a touchless ATM system that makes use of virtual hand gestures and face recognition technology.
The technology detects and interprets user motions precisely in real-time by combining machine learning algorithms with depth-sensing cameras. 
These motions correlate to common ATM functions such entering a PIN, withdrawing cash, checking balances, and confirming transactions.  
By bridging the gap between financial technology (FinTech) and user-centered design, this study advances the area of HCI. 
It lays the groundwork for further advancements in touchless interface technologies for banking and other industrial  domains.
